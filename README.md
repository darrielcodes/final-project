# Final Project

In this project, I built a superhero "twitter-verse" application. 

The theme is based in a superhero world where the user is a starter superhero who can see their friend's updates, stats and more.

## Features

* View/display incoming tweets
* Post/edit new tweets
* View each profile's statistics
* Get a nearby "mission" and sidekick for the mission

## Stretch Goals

* Delete new tweets
* Obtain more statistics 
* Create messages page where sidekick messages go

## Current Known Bugs
* Page not fully responsive
* Tweets stay 1/2 opacity when clicked instead of only one
* If you post a tweet, the stats section may be one user off
